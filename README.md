# Codename Spectrum
An open-source operating system that I'm making as a side project. The bootloader is provided by this repo: https://github.com/N00byEdge/bootelf


This is under the GPL license now because this: https://github.com/arjun024/mkeykernel/blob/master/LICENSE


Also naming system: Pick a codeword and make up a better name closer to release.
