# KillaOS
An open-source operating system that I'm making as a side project, with my own bootloader and kernel

IMPORTANT NOTE: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GRUB, AND BOOTLOADER IS NOT FINISHED, RENDERING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BOOT. 


Also naming system: Pick a codeword and make up a better name closer to release.
