# Codename Spectrum
An open-source operating system that I'm making as a side project. The bootloader is provided by this repo: https://github.com/N00byEdge/bootelf

NOTE: I'm not going to post instructions on how to use/build the bootloader, as I'm no longer using my own bootloader, as it was very challenging for me. I'm using the 'bootelf' bootloader, the Github page for that is here: https://github.com/N00byEdge/bootelf

Also, the OS is 64 bits now.


Also naming system: Pick a codeword and make up a better name closer to release.
